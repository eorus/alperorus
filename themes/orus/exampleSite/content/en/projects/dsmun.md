          <p>
           Sometimes it is enjoyable to help young people and create a long-lasting and active website. In this project, we created a MUN site for Darüşşafaka students, known as Model United Nations, with all schools participating. The students decided on the content and design, which is a small copy of the United Nations, and I did the coding and wordpress integration.</p>
