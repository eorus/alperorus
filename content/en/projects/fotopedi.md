          <p>
           Fotopedi, which started its publishing life as "TÃ¼rk Nikon", has written numerous articles on photography, shooting techniques and how to do it. For the last 5 years, the site has been continuing with the name Fotopedi in order not to stick to a brand and to continue as a photography encyclopedia. I have been carrying out the entire management individually for about 6 years.</p>
